## Library Management System
Welcome to the Library Management System! This project is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you manage your personal library or a small community library efficiently. Built with Python, it offers essential features such as adding new books, listing all available books, removing books, and searching for books by title or author.

## Features
- Add Books: Easily add new books to your library with details like book name, author, release date, and the number of pages.
- List Books: View a neatly formatted list of all the books in your library, complete with titles and authors.
- Remove Books: Keep your library up-to-date by removing books that are no longer available.
- Search Books: Find exactly what you're looking for with the ability to search the library's collection by book name or author.
## How It Works
The Library Management System is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward:

1. Initialization: On starting the application, the system checks for an existing library file (books.txt) or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.
2. User Interaction: Through a simple text-based menu, users can choose to add, list, remove, or search for books in the library.
3. Data Storage: All book entries are stored in a books.txt file, making data persistence simple and ensuring your library's catalog is always up-to-date.
